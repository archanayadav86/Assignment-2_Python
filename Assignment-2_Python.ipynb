    "Ans-->So a module in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. If you need those classes or functions in your project, you just import them. For instance, the math module in python contains just a bunch of functions, and you just call those needed.\n",
    "Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables). Modules may be mixed in to classes and other modules. The mixed in module's constants and methods blend into that class's own, augmenting the class's functionality. Classes, however, cannot be mixed in to anything."

This provides good starting guidance."
